# Simple Message dApp - Frontend

This is a small Next.js frontend for the **Simple Message dApp**. It lets you:

- View the current on-chain message stored in the `message-board` Clarity contract.
- Connect a Stacks wallet (demo-mode mock, similar to the counter example).
- Submit a new message (owner-only; first caller becomes owner).

## Getting Started

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.
